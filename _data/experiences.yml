  date: "2019 August - Present"
  description: |
    I have been part of both product and platform teams. I have worked together with product, design, to define features and upcoming streams of work. I was working closely with the Android and backend engineers during development to make sure features align across all platforms. We have used ReactiveSwift, ReactiveFeedback, Bento (Babylon’s UI framework build on UIKit) frameworks for development, and for testing, Nimble, Gherkin, and snapshot testing. Also contributed to our documentation, with articles about our processes, features.
    *Projects I have worked on*
    - Monitor Programs: I helped develop the next iteration of the Monitor dashboard, where users can set up composite care plans, to monitor their multiple conditions at once.
    - Medication Reminders: Delivered the redesigned medication reminders feature within Monitor. Users can set up reminders manually, or based on their GP’s prescription automatically.
    - COVID-19 Care Plan: Helped to deliver Babylon’s first features in response to the coronavirus pandemic. This set of features allowed users to monitor their symptoms and get help in case they got worse.
    - iOS platform: Since June 2020, I have been maintaining the iOS platform, including all our tooling, bots, and low-level features within the project. I have also worked on platform improvements to reduce our CI costs and build times, and to make development easier for the team.
    - Assisting releases: I have helped to release our iOS updates regularly, which involved fixing bugs in pre-release builds, verifying test cases, fixing crashes, and automating release steps.
